Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Kicking your can all over the place, singing
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
Sing it out
Somebody better put you back into your place
Waving your banner all over the place
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you, alright
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, sing it
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
[Verse 2]
[Verse 3]
